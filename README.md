# AnimeScraper
Anime web scraper made in Kotlin.

The NodeJS Express server is used for interacting with a database using Sequelize ORM as JetBrains Exposed isn't enough for this project at it's state.

It currently scrapes from JkAnime only and matches the Streaming items with Anime items that are linked to a MyAnimeList and an AniList entry for tracking and matching purposes. 

When more Streaming sites get added it would provide an easier way to match those site's items within them and external sources.

**Mahoutsukai no Yome:** MyAnimeList ID [35062](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35062) = [JkAnime entry](https://jkanime.net/mahoutsukai-no-yome/) = AniList ID [98436](https://anilist.co/anime/98436/Mahoutsukai-no-Yome/) = [AnimeFLV entry](https://www3.animeflv.net/anime/mahoutsukai-no-yome)
